<summary>‚úÖ Task 1: Branching & Switching</summary>

### 1. Initialize a Local Git Repository

```bash
git init
```
Creates an empty Git repository in the current directory.

---

### 2. Create and Switch to `feature-a` Branch

Attempting to run `git branch feature-a` before any commits results in:

```bash
fatal: not a valid object name: 'main'
```
This is because Git requires at least one commit to serve as the base for the new branch.

Instead, use:
```bash
git checkout -b feature-a
```

---

### 3. Create a File and Make an Initial Commit on `feature-a`

```bash
echo "example" > example.txt
git add example.txt
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
**Note:** Git requires a user name and email to be set before committing. Otherwise, it will throw an error like:
```
fatal: empty ident name (for <user@host>) not allowed
```

---

### 4. Create and Switch to `feature-b` Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature-b
```

---

### 5. Create a Bash Script to Switch Back to `feature-a`

```bash
printf '#!/bin/bash\n\ngit switch feature-a\n' > switch_to_feature_a.sh
chmod +x switch_to_feature_a.sh
```

Script contents:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

git switch feature-a
```

---

### 6. Commit the Script in `feature-b`

```bash
git add switch_to_feature_a.sh
git commit -m "Add switch script"
```

---

### 7. Run the Script to Switch Branches

```bash
./switch_to_feature_a.sh
```
Output:
```
Switched to branch 'feature-a'
```

---

### 8. Create a Third Branch

Now that an initial commit exists, creating a new branch with `git branch feature-c` works as expected.

```bash
git branch feature-c
```

---

### 9. Branch Listing

When running `git branch -a` before any commits, Git returns nothing because no branches (beyond HEAD) have actual commit references.

After creating commits and branches, `git branch -a` shows all local branches, even if a branch has no commits yet (like `feature-c`).

<summary>‚úÖ Task 2: Simulate and Resolve Merge Conflicts</summary>

### üéØ Goal:
Modify the same file (`example.txt`) in both `feature-a` and `feature-b` to simulate a conflict and resolve it.

### ‚úÖ Steps Performed:

**In `feature-b`:**
```bash
git switch feature-b
echo "adding conflict feature-b" >> example.txt
git add example.txt
git commit -m "Adding conflict feature-b"
```

**In `feature-a`:**
```bash
git switch feature-a
echo "adding conflict feature-a" >> example.txt
git add example.txt
git commit -m "Adding conflict feature-a"
```

**Merge `feature-b` into `feature-a`:**
```bash
git merge feature-b
```

You will see:
```
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in example.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Conflict Resolution:
Opened the folder using:
```bash
code .
```
Used the VS Code UI to resolve the conflict by selecting both changes.

**Final content of `example.txt`:**
```txt
example
adding conflict feature-a
adding conflict feature-b
```

Then:
```bash
git add example.txt
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict between feature-a and feature-b"
```

### ‚úÖ Final Status:
```bash
git status
# On branch feature-a
# nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Explanation of the Commit:
> The merge commit resolves a conflict between `feature-a` and `feature-b`, where both branches appended different lines to `example.txt`. Both changes were kept to preserve work from both branches.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note About `code .` Command:
Running `code .` just opens the current directory in VS Code ‚Äî this command is helpful but not necessary for the Git workflow. It was used to assist visually in resolving the conflict.

<summary>Task 3: Rebase and Cherry-Pick</summary>

- Use `git rebase` to reapply commits from `feature-a` onto `main`.
- Document what happens to the commit history.
- Use `git cherry-pick` to apply a single commit from `feature-b` to `main`.
- Explain the difference between `rebase` and `merge` in your own words.

<details>
<summary>Task 4: GitHub Pull Requests & Code Review</summary>

- Push both branches (`feature-a`, `feature-b`) to your GitHub repository.
- Create a pull request from one branch into `main`.
- Request a review from a classmate or mentor.
- Write at least one constructive code comment in someone else's pull request.

<summary>Task 5: Stash, Amend, and Cleanup</summary>

- Make local changes and store them using `git stash`.
- Restore the changes using `git stash pop`.
- Amend your last commit using `git commit --amend`.
- Clean up local branches that have already been merged.
